Very quick and dirty fix to the AkameGaKill theme for BD(BetterDiscord)
Currently all it does is fix the issue of it showing up and the original author's fonts/size are still broken.

This will be deleted when the original author's theme is fixed or by request of the original author ShadowDevilsAvenged


Currently does not completely fix the theme, all I've managed to do is get part of it working to where I personally find it acceptable to use.
Some things that I found that do not work properly are the text sizes/fonts from the original together with when discord is slightly faded/darkened when clicking something like "start streaming", the background goes fully black.
